Breast cancer is one of the most common and life-threatening cancers among women worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis plays a critical role in improving patient outcomes. Histopathological analysis of breast tissue samples is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, but manual examination by pathologists can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error.

In this project, we aim to develop an automated deep learning-based system that can classify breast cancer histopathology images into benign or malignant categories with high accuracy and robustness. We propose a hybrid deep learning architecture that leverages the strengths of:

InceptionV3 for extracting fine-grained local features from microscopic images,

Vision Transformers (ViT) for capturing global contextual relationships,

and Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to utilize unlabeled data and improve model generalization.

By integrating these advanced techniques, our goal is to build a powerful, interpretable, and scalable model that can assist pathologists and medical professionals in making faster and more reliable diagnoses, especially in resource-constrained settings.
